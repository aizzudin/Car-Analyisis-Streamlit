The distinction is that we have added some visuals in this instance so that you can explore the unseen potential of the deal you might not aware of. 

This app's data is sourced from Kaggle.com. Data is static and was taken from the market in India. As a result, certain brands may be unfamiliar to you and other regions of the world may have different price points. 

Enjoy finding your dream car!""")
